# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server becomes unresponsive due to a long-running synchronous operation blocking the event loop.  The example shows a simple HTTP server that simulates a 5-second delay within the request handler.  During this delay, the server will not be able to handle other requests, effectively causing it to hang.

## Problem

Node.js is single-threaded.  Long-running operations in the main thread block the event loop, preventing the server from responding to new requests or handling other events.  This can lead to poor performance and unresponsiveness.

## Solution

The solution involves using asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the event loop.  This can be achieved through techniques like:

* **Using asynchronous functions:** Employ asynchronous methods such as `setTimeout`, `fs.readFile`, database queries using promises, etc.
* **Worker threads:** For CPU-bound tasks, consider offloading the work to separate worker threads using the `worker_threads` module.
* **Clustering:** To handle a high volume of requests, use the `cluster` module to create multiple worker processes.

The solution provided demonstrates using asynchronous operations to handle the long-running task, making the server responsive.
